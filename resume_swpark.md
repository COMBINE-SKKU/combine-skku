    summary: >
      Hello, I joined the COMBINE Lab as a postdoctoral researcher. My research interests are primarily driven to prevent dysfunctional behavior and promote health by implementing neuroscientific methods. By identifying neuroimaging-based biomarkers that occur early in the brain prior to symptom manifestation, I aim to distinguish those with heightened vulnerability to facilitate identification of at-risk individuals in need of early, effective, and targeted intervention. At the COMBINE Lab, I am investigating the effects of sensory development on higher order functions in terms of functional brain gradients in typical and atypical neurological development.

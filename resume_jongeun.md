    summary: >
      Welcome, I'm a PhD student in the Electrical, and Computer Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU). My research interests are primarily related with strong consensus that neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., ASD, ADHD) perceive and process the external world atypically. In particular, I want to understand whole-brain semantic representation mapped during the movie-watching fMRI. To that end, a variety of methods are employed in my project: encoding model, MR-based eye tracking, shared response model, feature extraction from movie using deep neural networks.

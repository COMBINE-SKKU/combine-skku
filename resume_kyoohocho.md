      Hello. I am a clinical neuroscientist who graduated from Yonsei medical school and got a doctorate in philosophyin 2020. With experience of ten years as a neurologist in Severance hospital, I have a wealth of clinical experience and knowledge of research with accomplishment of a few publication. My subspeciality in neuroscience spans epilepsy, sleep disorders, and disorders of consciousness. I also have skills especially in quantitative neuroimaging, neurophysiology (intracranial EEG and MEG) and basic computer programming.I am glad to meet Combine members to collaborate with, in projects such as large-scale brain dynamic modelling of epilepsy and its comorbid condition.

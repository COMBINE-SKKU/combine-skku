  summary: >
    Hi there, I am a computational neuroscientist with a spectialty in brain network modeling and data-driven subtyping of typical and atypical developmental conditions. I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), and in a full time affiliation with IBS Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (CNIR) in S.Korea. I am also jointly affiliated as a research scientist to the Center for the Developing Brain at the Child Mind Institute in New York. Building upon expertise in computer science, statistics and neuroinformatics, I have actively conducted neuroimaging experiments to link cognitive/clinical neuroscience and machine learning algorithms for the last 10 years. At SKKU and CMI, I am expanding my research scope to apply advanced statistical and computational algorithms to model functional dynamics and analyze various behavioral and neuroimaging data of both human and non-human primate brains.

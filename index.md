# Welcome to the COMBINE Lab!
<div style="text-align:justify">We are Computational Brain Imaging and Network Modeling (COMBINE) Lab. Using diverse neuroimaging and statistical approaches, our research focuses on identifying parismonious principles underlying large-scale brain organizations and neurodynamics in both typical and atypcial conditions. In delivering these goals, we are seeking to implement multi-method (connectomics, computational modeling), multi-modal (structure and function), and multi-scale (circuit-level, large-scale network) analytics and capture individual variations in the complex behavioral and clinical outcomes. We also aim at transferring this neuroscience-grounded knowledge to develop biologically more plusible AI algorithms such as biophysical deep neural network.</div>

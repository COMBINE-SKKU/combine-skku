# Welcome to the COMBINE Lab!
![research perspective](/assets/img/research_perspective.png)<br/>
<div style="text-align:left">We are the research group of Computational Brain Imaging and Network Modeling (COMBINE). "COMBINE" is not a simply eye-catching acronym for the lab title but represents the main research perspective we are pursuing. Combining diverse neuroimaging approaches, conceptual frameworks and biological scales, our research aims at identifying system-level principles for large-scale organization of the brain and its neurodynamics in both typical and atypcial conditions. In performing the research, we are seeking to implement multi-method (connectomics, computational modeling), multi-modal (structure and function), and multi-scale (circuit-level, large-scale network and behhaviors) analytical approaches that may capture individual variations in complex behavioral and clinical outcomes. Based on these research tools, we are ultimately targeting to develop effect imaging-based biomarkers </div>

# Welcome to the COMBINE Lab!
We are Computational Brain Imaging and Network Modeling (COMBINE) Lab. Using diverse neuroimaging techniques and statistical approaches, our research focuses on identifying parismonious principles underlying large-scale brain organizations and neurodynamics in both typical and atypcial conditions. To deliver these goals, we are seeking to implementing multi-method (e.g., connectomics, computational modeling), multi-modal (e.g., structure, functions), and multi-scale (e.g., circuit, large-scale networks) analytics and capturing individual variations in the complex behavioral and clinical outcomes. W also aim at transferring this neuroscience-grounded knowledge to develop biologically more plusible AI algorithms such as biophysical deep neural network.

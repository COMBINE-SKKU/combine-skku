# Welcome to the COMBINE Lab!
We are Computational Brain Imaging and Network Modeling (COMBINE) Lab. Using diverse neuroimaging techniques and statistical approaches, our research focuses on identifying parismonious principles underlying large-scale brain organizations and neurodynamics in both typical and atypcial conditions. In delivering these ambitious goals, we are seeking to implementing multi-method (e.g., connectomics, computational tissue modeling), multi-modal (e.g., structure and functions), and multi-scale (e.g., circuit, large-scale network systems and behaviors) analytical approaches and capturing the variation of individuals in their complex behavioral and clinical outcomes. Finally, we also aim at transferring this neuroscience-grounded knowledge to guide to develop biologically more plusible artifical intelligence algorithms such as biophysical deep neural network.

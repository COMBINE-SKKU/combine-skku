    summary: >
      Hi there, I am undergraduate student of department of global biomedical engineering. I joined COMBINE lab in 4th semester as an undergraduate research assistant in the interest of PI's research about connectome and biomarker studies about autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. Currently, I'm studying on quantitative measuring and group-wise comparison of tractography algorithms using diffuion MRI images. My research interests are neural network and biomarker about both psychiatric and neurosurgical disease modeling using machine learning method,  which were driven by the aim for preventing neurolgical disease by diagonising at the early stage and retarding the progression of disease so that patients are able to resume their life  as soon as possible.

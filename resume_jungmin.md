      Hello. I’m a student in the Department of Global Biomedical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU). I am interested in understanding human cognition and intelligence. To this end, I aim to study how the brain predicts and processes errors as sensory signals enter. I am also interested in reinforcement learning and machine learning, hence I want to proceed with these fields in the future.

    summary: >
      Hello. I’m a student in the Department of Global Biomedical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU). I am interested in understanding human cognition as a whole, such as what human cognition is, how it is formed, what mechanisms it has, and even how it can be connected to current artificial intelligence. To this end, my research interest aims to study predictive coding to find out if the brain continues to generate and update models used to predict sensory inputs that are compared to actual. I am also interested in reinforcement learning and machine learning.
